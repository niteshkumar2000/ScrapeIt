# ScrapeIt
Scrapy Bot which scrapes data from the popular websites.
This scrapy bot is generated by popular python package **scrapy**.
# How to start
Initially we have to create a scrapy project.
```bash
scrapy startproject projname
```
Then change directory and generate spider for the website to be scraped.
```bash
cd projname
scrapy genspider spiderclassname domain
```
> Note: Domain name should not include **https://**

Locate the file and start designing the bot.
# How to test
**Scrapy shell** helps us to test the commands and see the reslts instantly.
```bash
scrapt shell "URL"
```
> Note:URL should be inside the quotes.

Then you can check the scraped site by typing the command
```bash
view(response)
```
if it return *true*, the page will be displayed in your default browser.

Data can be scraped using two techniques,
1. XPath (Recomended).
2. Css Selector.

# How to run
You can clone the repo and navigate to any of the folders and type,
```bash
cd projname
scrapy crawl spiderclassname
```
the output will be rendered as a json on the console. You can also save the output in *.json* or *.csv* file by typing,
```bash
scrapy crawl spiderclassname -o result.json
scrapy crawl spiderclassname -o result.csv
```

Happy Scraping :)
